This folder contains the file output and package files from using Jest to test the extension.
Files were testing in VSCode with Jest plugin.

-------------------------------------
Commands:
npm init -y
// Initialized the package to allow for testing

npm i --save-dev jest
// Install Jest

npm test
// Run tests

-------------------------------------
Notes: 
1. Output was generated by 
```"scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage"
  },
```
  
in the package json file.

2. Jest package was not uploaded as it can be gotten from the commands above.
